I look at various methods of sorting data / Algorithms such as bubble sort, selection sort and merge sort.
I test the most efficient method of sorting algorithms and by the end of the project I get to understand that merge sort is the best and most efficient method of thethree especially in large data sets.
These methods are helpful in almost all programming languages
